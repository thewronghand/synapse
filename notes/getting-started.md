# Getting Started with Synapse

This guide will help you get up and running with Synapse.

## Creating Notes

There are several ways to create a new note:

1. Click the "New Note" button in the sidebar
2. Click on a [[wiki-link]] that doesn't exist yet
3. Use the keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + N)

## Organizing Your Notes

### Using Folders

You can organize notes in folders:
- Just use `/` in the note name: `projects/synapse`
- Folders are created automatically

### Using Tags

Add tags to your frontmatter:

```markdown
---
tags: [project, important]
---
```

## Linking Notes

Create connections between notes using [[wiki-links]]:

- `[[Note Name]]` - creates a link
- `[[Note Name|Display Text]]` - link with custom text
- Links work even if the note doesn't exist yet
